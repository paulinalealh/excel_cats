## Excel Cats Project

Hello! In this repository, you’ll find an Excel file containing analytics for a population of 1,000 cats. Surprisingly, the original dataset was already clean, so I decided to enhance it by adding two new columns: Age Brackets and Weight Brackets, which I thought would be useful for the Pivot Tables later on.

Creating the Pivot Tables was a bit challenging, since the original table had relatively few columns and a wide variety of breeds. In the end, I focused on charting other characteristics—such as gender, color, weight, and age—while leaving breeds for the interactive component of the dashboard.

Coloring the charts was my favorite part, as color plays a major role in helping to interpret the graphs effectively. I also included an image of the dashboard for anyone who’s curious to see it.
